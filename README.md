Apache OpenWhisk is a cloud-first distributed event-based programming service. It provides a programming model to upload event handlers to a cloud service, and register the handlers to respond to various events.

## Quickstart for Local Development

### Install Prerequisites

* Download and install Nodejs: see [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* Download and install Ruby: see [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

``` sh
# Verify Node and Node Package Manager are installed
node -v
npm -v

# Verify Ruby is installed
ruby env

# Install Jekyll, which is used to build the site
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### Clone and start development server

``` sh
# Clone the repository (and correct branch).
git clone https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk.github.io.git

# Move into the cloned repo.
cd openwhisk.github.io

# Install gem dependcies
bundle install

# Start the development server default location http://127.0.0.1:4000
bin/develop
```

## How to Build Jekyll to Output Static Files

If you need to generate static files, run the following:

``` sh
# NOTE: Make sure you have already cloned the repo and moved into the directory.

# Build the site.
bundle exec jekyll build
```

This will build static files to a directory called `_site/` in the project root. This can be used for manual deployment to a static server or with build tools like Jenkins.

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error 'bundle: command not found' attempting to build the site, you may need to manually install the 'bundler' package:
``` sh
 gem install bundler
```
