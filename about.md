Apache OpenWhisk is a [serverless]({{ site.github.url }}/serverless), open
source cloud platform that allows you to execute code in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk handles the infrastructure and servers so you can focus on building amazing things.

Apache OpenWhisk allows [developers]({{ site.github.url }}/developers) to focus on writing value-adding code instead of burning hours on architecture and server management. Write in your preferred language to combine custom code with plug-and-play packages from our rich ecosystem of supporter services, and go live in hours instead of weeks.

[Package creators]({{ site.github.url }}/package-creators) can easily add their service to Apache OpenWhiskâ€™s growing ecosystem to eliminate the need to build in-house solutions for third-party integrations, reach a broader community of developers, and increase adoption of their products and services.

The Apache OpenWhisk community is driven by [open source contributors]({{ site.github.url }}/contributors) who are advancing this bleeding-edge technology, growing their skillsets, and pushing the boundaries of serverless technology.
